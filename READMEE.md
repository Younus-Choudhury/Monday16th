#The python code to execute is called Finalcodeinstitute.py ,  The LMS, Various Ai,  lectures from code instiitute as well as various  online by youTubers like Code Bros etc have been used extensivly to generate the assignment code.   After the graphs were generated in python I also used chat GPT to describe the graphs and generate a report which is below and would be expected alongside any data analytics project.

# An Analysis of Retail Store Performance (2010–2012)

This report examines retail performance data from 45 stores during the 2010–2012 period by reviewing four key visualisations. These include the scatter plot *"Store Performance: Size vs Total Sales (2010–2012)"*, the bar chart *"Weekly Sales Distribution"*, the heat map *"Weekly Sales Distribution"*, and the boxplot *"Sales Distribution by Store Type (2010–2012)"*. Together, these charts provide a multifaceted view of how store size, seasonal fluctuations, and operational consistency shape overall sales performance.

## Store Performance: Size vs Total Sales (2010–2012) – Scatter Plot

The scatter plot clearly demonstrates that larger retail outlets tend to achieve higher total sales. In this diagram, stores classified as Type A cluster in the upper-right quadrant, signifying that economies of scale and superior operational capabilities play a pivotal role in driving revenue. While the trend shows that greater square footage generally correlates with increased sales, the relationship is not strictly linear. Several mid-sized Type B stores do not fully keep pace with their larger counterparts, implying that factors such as business model and execution quality are also crucial. This chart invites decision-makers to consider not only the physical store size but also the operational strategies deployed across different formats.

## Weekly Sales Distribution – Bar Chart

The bar chart, titled *"Weekly Sales Distribution"*, plots the frequency of weekly sales figures. The x-axis represents weekly sales (in dollars), while the y-axis shows the frequency of those sales. The distribution is heavily right-skewed; most weeks register moderate sales, but a few outlier weeks bring extremely high figures. Two reference markers are evident in the chart—a red dashed line indicating the mean weekly sale of $16,224 and a green dashed line showing the median of $7,739. The pronounced difference between mean and median figures reinforces the influence of exceptional weeks on overall performance. Such a disparity suggests that while typical weeks may see modest sales, a small number of high-performing periods contribute disproportionately to annual totals.

## Weekly Sales Distribution – Heat Map

Adding a temporal dimension, the heat map titled *"Weekly Sales Distribution"* presents a year-long view of average weekly sales across the store network. This visualization uncovers distinct seasonal patterns within the retail cycle. A marked peak is visible around Week 17, hinting at heightened activity during this period—possibly driven by well-timed promotional campaigns or seasonal consumer demand. Conversely, Week 26 consistently records lower sales, indicating a natural slowdown following peak periods. For retail managers, these seasonal trends underscore the importance of timing marketing campaigns and operational adjustments to better balance the highs and lows of the trading cycle.

## Sales Distribution by Store Type (2010–2012) – Boxplot

The boxplot *"Sales Distribution by Store Type (2010–2012)"* further refines our understanding by comparing weekly sales across different store types. Type A and Type B stores display a median weekly sale around or just above $40,000, yet Type A records occasional outliers that reflect exceptionally high sales events—likely the result of targeted promotions. In contrast, the boxplot for Type C stores shows both a lower median and a wider interquartile range, suggesting a steadier but persistently lower level of performance. This divergence points to different operational challenges and opportunities: while larger formats might rely on powerful promotional spikes, smaller stores would benefit from strategies focused on elevating their consistent, underlying performance.

## Conclusion

The integrated insights from these visualisations reveal that retail success is a complex interplay of physical scale and refined operational strategy. For UK-based MBA strategists, the clear lesson is that while store size can drive increased sales, it is equally essential to manage seasonal trends, promotional timing, and operational detail to achieve sustainable long-term profitability. By aligning the tangible asset of store size with tactical trading strategies and market rhythms, retail managers can build a robust and resilient business model that thrives in a dynamic marketplace.
